## Instructions

In the not-so-distant future, humans discover a potential planet to replace Earth, planet NEXUS. However, the astronauts realize a problem... THEY ARE NOT ALONE ON THIS PLANET!

There are alien creatures, which the astronauts call 'Nexus Beasts', that are extremely dangerous and aggressive. To achieve a peaceful colonization, the astronauts try to explore sectors of the planet, avoiding encounters with a Nexus Beast.

To do this, they must uncover each sector (one by one), where in each sector, they may find:

· A Nexus Beast.
· Nexus Beast tracks, which can help determine the number of beasts around that sector.

Your mission is to assist the astronauts in discovering all the sectors of planet Nexus and achieving peaceful colonization!
